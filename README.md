Dynamic typification for C++ objects

Further development or dynamic object typification (DOT) will be developed in another repository:
https://github.com/qualab/dot

Because of smaller object, no binding to RTTI in runtime type hierarchy identification and flexible dot::copyable<type> without using std::shared_ptr and handle block of memory with handling of reference counter by special atomic inside this memory block.
